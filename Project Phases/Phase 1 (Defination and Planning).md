# Project phase 1 - Definition and Planning


Welcome to NumBase. This is the first phase.

Easily manage and explore number systems using this comprehensive toolkit.

Convert values between binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal formats, perform arithmetic operations, and access a history of your recent activity — all in one place.


## 1. User Personas
