# Phase 3 : Improvements

### Description

During the Phase 3 of the NumBase project, the focus was on refining the application. The enhancements mostly addresses UI/UX, error handling and improving the overall functionality. Additionally, the application was subjected to automatic and manual testings.

### Implementation

The following improvements covers all five use cases of this project:

- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary parts of codes and simplified everything.
- **Smooth Results**: Prevented unnecessary API calls during rapid user input, ensuring smoother performance.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages by catching more invalidations.
- **Copy Button Feedback**: Added visual feedback to the copy buttons to indicate successful copying.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Combined and clearly separated the converter and calculator sections for simplicity and ease.
- **Styling Enhancements**: Applied consistent styling to headings and links to create a cohesive look.
- **Testing**: Successfully tested core functions and interactions with Jest and Playwright. Manually tested for confirmations.

  
### Challenges

- **I/O Handling**: Ensuring smooth real-time updates without causing flickers. (Needs more improvement)
- **Visual Consistency**: Achieving a balanced and consistent look across all sections of the app.
- **Error Handling**: Fully handling errors both from both backend and frontend.


### Outcome

The application is able to fulfill its promises and all use cases/features were successfully implemented. The enhancements led to a more polished and reliable application. Users can now interact with the converter and calculator more efficiently, with clear feedback and a visually appealing interface. Still there is room for improvements. Looking forward to the final phase.
